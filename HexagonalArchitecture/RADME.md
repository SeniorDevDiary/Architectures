Hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters architecture, promotes a clean separation between the core business logic and the external systems. This design makes applications more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changes.

In this Node.js example, we build a simple blog application to demonstrate hexagonal architecture. The project structure is divided into core domain, ports, and adapters.

Core Domain contains the business logic and domain models:

    BlogPost.js defines the BlogPost entity.
    BlogService.js contains the business logic for managing blog posts.

Ports are interfaces that define how the core interacts with the outside world:

    BlogRepository.js is an abstract class that defines methods for saving and retrieving blog posts.

Adapters implement these interfaces to connect the core logic with external systems:

    InMemoryBlogRepository.js provides an in-memory implementation of the BlogRepository interface.
    BlogController.js uses Express to handle HTTP requests and interacts with the BlogService.

In this architecture:

    Core Logic is isolated, making it easy to test and maintain.
    Ports act as boundaries, defining interactions with external systems.
    Adapters bridge the core logic and external systems, allowing flexibility in changing implementations.

For instance, switching from an in-memory repository to a persistent database requires changes only in the adapter, not in the core logic.

This separation ensures that the core business logic remains unaffected by changes in external systems, leading to a more robust and flexible application design.

'ports' are also called 'usecases'

Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture

    Separation of Concerns: By decoupling the core business logic from external systems, each part of the application can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
    Testability: The core logic can be tested in isolation using unit tests, and adapters can be tested using integration tests.
    Flexibility: Allows easy substitution of external systems. For example, switching from one database to another requires only changing the driven adapter without modifying the core logic.
    Maintainability: With clear boundaries and responsibilities, the codebase becomes easier to understand and modify.

This structure ensures that the core domain logic is decoupled from external systems, making the application more maintainable and adaptable to changes. For example, switching from an in-memory database to a persistent database requires only changes in the adapter, not in the core logic.
